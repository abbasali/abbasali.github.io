I'm excited to announce the launch of my redesigned website, now built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the elegant [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/tree/main) theme. This modern platform showcases my work, insights, and journey in web development while demonstrating my commitment to adopting the right technology for each project.

While my expertise lies heavily in dynamic web applications using PHP and Laravel, technologies I continue to champion for complex and data-driven solutions, I chose Jekyll for this particular project to leverage the simplicity and performance benefits of static site generation.

The new site is hosted on GitHub Pages, offering exceptional reliability and global content delivery. This choice aligns with my philosophy of selecting technologies that best serve the project's goals rather than defaulting to familiar tools.
